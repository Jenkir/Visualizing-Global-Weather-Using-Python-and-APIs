The objective of this assignment was to create a Python script to visualize weather of over 500 cities globally, based on their distance from the equator.

I created a series of scatter plots to show the following relationships:

![Latitude and Temperature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75215001/126909523-9be8339a-91b9-4bfc-8de0-7e59fea6b792.png)


![Latitude and Humidity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75215001/126909540-44a7336b-33d5-48a7-954e-95a3f27a0ff9.png)


![Latitude and Cloudiness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75215001/126909556-a49ae91c-97d9-4411-af52-85ee977e7c65.png)


![Latitude and Windspeed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75215001/126909560-b6ceaec4-a890-4dc6-8b18-8a4203d85ebc.png)


Next, I ran a linear regression on each relationship. For example, I showed what the linear regression was modeling for the Northern Hemisphere - Latitude vs. Temperature.
